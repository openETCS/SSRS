The diagram 'functions' consists of four levels:
 - block 'High Level Functions'
 - main-functions (defined by Baseliyos)
 - sub-functions (defined by Baseliyos)
 - on-board-functions (assigned by Simon according to figure 1, chapter 4.5 'Active Functions table', SRS and the related SRS paragraphs as specified there)

The model uses only Block Definition Diagrams and Internal Block Diagrams.
The Internal Block Diagrams show just an overwiev, not exact internal structure.

The meaning of the colours:
 - cyan: block 'High level Functions' for retrieveability
Other colours mark double assignments of on-board-functions. These on-board-functions are itemized multiple.
Different colours represent different sections of figure 1, chapter 4.5 'Active Functions table', SRS. (Not each section is needed to be enlisted.)
 - red: 'Determine Train Speed and Location'
 - black: 'Determine Most Restrictive Speed Profile, based on:'
 - yellow: 'Supervise Train Speed'
 - green: 'Supervise Train Movements'
 - blue: 'Other funtions'
